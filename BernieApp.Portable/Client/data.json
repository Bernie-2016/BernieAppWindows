He will not back away from land stewardship standards that include the commonwealth of clean water for all.\n\nAs president, Senator Sanders will adopt policies that will:\n\n\nMake sure that family farmers and rural economies thrive;\n\nExpand support for young and beginning farmers;\n\nProduce an abundant and nutritious food supply;\n\nEstablish an on-going regeneration of our soils; and\n\nEnlist farmers as partners in promoting conservation and stewardship to keep our air and water clean and to combat climate change.\n\n\nFamily Farms Instead of Factory Farms\n\nSenator Sanders believes that we need more family farms, not more factory farms.\n\nIt is unacceptable that just four corporations control 82% of the nation’s beef cattle market, 85% of soybean processing, and 63% of pork processing.  It is unacceptable that there are over 300,000 fewer farmers than there were 20 years ago.\n\nIt is unacceptable that the top 10% of farms collect 75% of farm subsidies, while the bottom 62% do not receive any subsidies.  We have to adopt policies that will turn this around.\n\nSupporting Agriculture\n\nIn 1966, farmers received 40 cents for every dollar Americans spent on food. Today, they only receive 16 cents on the dollar.\n\nAs President, Senator Sanders will reverse this trend by:\n\n\nFighting for America’s small and mid-sized farms.\nAbraham Lincoln called the United States Department of Agriculture the “People’s Department” and Senator Sanders will ensure that the agency lives up to this name by expanding its services for new and underserved farmers.\n\nEncouraging the growth of regional food systems.\nFarmers throughout the country are boosting their bottom line and reinvigorating their communities by selling directly to local consumers, institutions, and restaurants. Senator Sanders will invest in this movement, helping Americans support local farms.\n\nReversing trade policies like NAFTA\nthat have flooded the American market with agricultural goods produced in countries with less stringent environmental, labor, and safety regulations.\n\nEnforcing our country’s antitrust laws against large agribusiness and food corporations.\nA few large companies dominate many agricultural industries, allowing them to force unfair prices on farmers. Senator Sanders will stand up to these corporations and fight to ensure that farmers receive fair prices.\n\n\nINVESTING IN RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT AND NEW INCOME FOR FARMERS\n\nSenator Sanders supports major investments in wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and other sources of renewable energy.  These investments are not only important to combat global warming, they are also critically important in improving the farm economy.\n\nThe good news is that farmers and ranchers all over this country are leading the charge toward a more sustainable energy future.\n\nToday, more than 57,000 farms are taking advantage of renewable energy production — which has more than doubled since 2007.\n\nNowhere is that more true than in Iowa.  Today, farmers and rural landowners in Iowa receive over $17 million in lease payments from wind developers – and have the potential to nearly triple over the next 15 years.\n\nToday, Iowa reliably generates over 28% of its electricity from wind — which supports 7,000 good-paying jobs in-state.\n\nSenator Sanders would substantially increase investments in wind energy and would make the Wind Production Tax Credit permanent.  By making these investments, wind could supply over 40 percent of Iowa’s electricity in the next five years.  By 2030 wind energy in Iowa could supply enough electricity for 6.3 million average American homes.\n\nAnd, it’s not only wind.  Biofuels like ethanol have been an economic lifeline to rural and farm communities in Iowa and throughout the Midwest, supporting over 850,000 workers, all while keeping our energy dollars here at home instead of going into the pockets of oil barons in the Middle East and Russia.\n\nSenator Sanders strongly supports the Renewable Fuels Standard that is helping us move beyond oil.\n\nMoreover, when we talk about harnessing energy from the sun, the good news is that solar panels accounted for more than 60% of renewable energy production systems on farms.  According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the cost of residential solar has come down 75% since 2009.\n\nOver half of the electric generating capacity added to the grid last year was renewable energy from new wind and solar projects. There is enough solar power in America to power four million homes. And, as we generate new sustainable energy, we also generate new opportunities. Today, the rate of job growth in the solar industry is ten times higher than the national average.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, much more needs to be done to ensure our planet remains habitable, improve the environment, and help our farmers in Iowa and across the country.  Substantially increasing our investments in renewable energy will be a major priority in a Sanders administration.\n\nBERNIE’S PLAN TO REBUILD RURAL AMERICA\n\nAddressing the infrastructure crisis facing the country – and creating the millions of jobs our economy desperately needs – has been an essential plank of Senator Sanders’ campaign.\n\nSenator Sanders’ Rebuild America Act will make substantial infrastructure investments in Iowa and throughout rural America.\n\nImproving our electric grid.\nSenator Sanders understands that we desperately need to improve our aging rural electrical grid, which consists of a patchwork system of interconnected power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, some of which date back to the early 1900s.\n\nToday, the World Economic Forum ranks our electric grid at just 24\nth\nin the world in terms of reliability, just\nbehind\nBarbados.\n\nAs part of the Rebuild America Act, Senator Sanders would invest $50 billion on power transmission and distribution modernization projects to improve the reliability and resiliency of our ever more complex electric power grid.  This investment will also position our grid to accept new sources of locally generated renewable energy, and it will address critical vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks.\n\nInvesting in broadband and high-speed Internet services.\nAnother critically important rural infrastructure issue that often goes overlooked is the expansion of broadband. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranks the U.S. 16th in the world in terms of broadband access.\n\nToday, people living in Bucharest, Romania have access to much faster Internet than most of the United States.  That’s unacceptable and must change.\n\nSenator Sanders’ Rebuild America Act would invest $25 billion over five years to expand high-speed broadband networks in under-served and un-served areas, and would boost speeds and capacity all across the country, particularly in rural areas.\n\nHigh-speed Internet access is no longer a luxury.  It is essential for 21st century commerce, education, telemedicine, and public safety.  And, it’s especially important for rural America to stay connected and to do business with the rest of the world.\n\nImproving our dams and levees.\nSenator Sanders’ plan also addresses dams and levees. Right now, more than 4,000 of the nation’s 84,000 dams are considered deficient.\n\nEven worse, one of every eleven levees have been rated as “likely to fail” during a major flood. Most of those facilities are in rural areas.\n\nThe Rebuild America Act will invest $12 billion a year to repair and improve the high-hazard dams that provide flood control, drinking water, irrigation, hydropower, and recreation across rural America; and the flood levees that protect our farms and our towns and cities.\n",

          "body": "SOUTH BOSTON, Mass. – Contrasting his record and her rhetoric, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday laid out key differences with Hillary Clinton in their contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.\n\n“People need to know the difference between hastily-adopted campaign rhetoric and the real record and long-held ideas of the candidates,” Sanders said during a news conference at a labor union hall. He spelled out differences with Clinton on trade policy and talked about the difference between his people-powered campaign and her Wall Street-bankrolled Super PAC.\n\nHe called for overturning the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United. The disastrous 2010 decision led to creation of super PACs, like Clinton’s Priorities USA, which take unlimited sums from millionaires and billionaires. There is what Sanders called “a very profound difference” between his campaign – funded by more than 4 million individual donations averaging $27 apiece – and Clinton’s super PAC, which in the last half of 2015 raised $25 million from powerful special interests including $15 million from Wall Street.\n\n“Now I know that every candidate who has ever received special-interest money always says that the millions of dollars they receive will never influence them. Never, never, never. Well, Americans need to ask a simple question. If these contributions from powerful special interests have no influence over the candidates, why are they making huge campaign contributions?” Sanders asked.\n\nOn trade, Sanders welcomed Clinton’s new-found resistance to a proposed Pacific Rim trade deal but noted that she was sympathetic to it in the past and favored other bad trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. The trade pacts promoted by multi-national corporations have contributed to the shutdown of 60,000 U.S. factories and resulted in the loss of good-paying jobs in the United States. While Clinton may have shifted stands recently, Sanders noted that Thomas Donahue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, predicted she would do another about-face and support the business-backed deal if she wins the White House.\n\nAt the same news conference, Sanders was endorsed by People’s Politics, a grassroots group that fights for racial and economic justice.\n\n“I hold many identities within me,” Maria Elena Letona, executive director of Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts Action, said. “I am an Afro-Latina, immigrant, woman. Like me, no one in our country is simply one thing. The crisis we face today is complex. We need a leader who won’t separate economic inequality from the fight to end racism. We need a leader who represents us as a whole people. The promise of Bernie Sanders’ campaign is that the political revolution is big enough for all of us.”\n\nThe members of People’s Politics endorsing Sanders today include Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts Action, Maine People’s Alliance, Vocal-N.Y. Action Fund, Community Voices Heard Power of New York and SouthWest Organizing Project Action of New Mexico. Several members of People’s Politics, The Reclaim Campaign/The People’s Lobby of Illinois, Rights and Democracy of Vermont and New Hampshire and Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action, have already endorsed Sanders bid for the White House.\n\nSanders flew to Massachusetts for the news conference here and a rally in Amherst after campaigning in South Carolina, where Democrats vote on Saturday. Voters in Massachusetts and 11 other states hold caucuses or go to the polls in one week on Super Tuesday.",

Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas and Governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio.\n\nSanders polled nearly three times better than Hillary Clinton in head-to-head contests with Trump. The former secretary of state also languished behind Sanders in general election matchups against the other Republican White House hopefuls, according to the poll for WMUR-TV and CNN.\n\nResults released on Tuesday from the same University of New Hampshire Research Center survey found that 60 percent of likely Democratic Party primary voters say they would vote for Sanders compared to 33 percent for Clinton.\n\n“There is excitement and energy for Bernie that no other candidate can match,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager. “His message that it is time to do something about the rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system is resonating with voters in New Hampshire and other states.\n\nSanders “currently has double digit leads over five potential Republican challengers in New Hampshire” while Clinton leads Trump “but is deadlocked with four other potential challengers,” according to the University of New Hampshire Research Center.\n\n“Hillary Clinton says Democrats should look at which candidate is the most electable and we couldn’t agree more,” Weaver added. “These new poll numbers in New Hampshire are the most recent evidence that Bernie would be the best Democratic nominee to retain the White House and help regain the Senate and elect Democrats all across the country.”\n\nIn a hypothetical contest with Trump, Sanders led by 23 points in New Hampshire, outpolling the Republican real estate developer by 57 percent to 34 percent. Clinton, by contrast, has only a single-digit margin over Trump, 48 percent to 39 percent.\n\nDriving this divide is Sanders’ strength with independent voters, in contrast to Clinton who struggles with this key bloc of voters. Notably, Sanders leads Trump with independents by a 22-point margin while Clinton actually trails the real estate mogul by 9 points, a net 31-point difference.\n\n“This same pattern emerges in all of the head-to-head match-ups with Republicans between Sanders and Clinton,” said Sanders’ pollster Ben Tulchin. “This real strength with independents – both overall and especially compared to Clinton – positions Sanders very well for the general election and gives him a real edge over Clinton as the more electable candidate, especially recalling that New Hampshire is a swing state that Al Gore lost in the 2000 general election.”\n\nSanders led Christie and Cruz by 23 points, was 21 points up on Kasich and 18 points over Rubio. Clinton lost to Rubio, tied Kasich and led Christie by less than the survey’s margin of error.",
